## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository's page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```
3. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name that summarizes your feature or bug fix.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```
4. **Make Changes:** Make your changes, following the coding conventions and guidelines described in the project.

5. **Test Your Changes:** Ensure that your changes work as expected and that you have added tests if necessary.

6. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

7. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

8. Create a Pull Request: Go to the GitHub page of your forked repository, switch to the branch with your changes, and click the "New Pull Request" button. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request.


## Code Style and Guidelines

A few general rules:

- When adding new classes or files make sure to follow the [data model](#data-model).
- Make sure existing unit tests pass and add new ones if possible.
  - For example, if you add a new pathfinding algorithm you'll need to add unit tests in the `SimulationTest` and `SimulationFactoryTest` files.
- Make sure any new features work properly before creating a PR. You can do this by building a jar file and adding it your local server.
  - One way to test new features/fixes is to create a temporary class that implements `CommandExecutor`, then call the static methods on `McPathfinding`.
  - Watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyzcll2JNOA) by [The Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBreakdownXYZ) on how to set up up a local server if you don't have one.
